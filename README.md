## Retrospective

In this project I learned to apply my knowledge of JavaScript Arrays, Objects, Attributes, Functions, While/If loops/statements, and Methods. I gathered a substantial understanding of the task simply by looking through past activities, drills, and lastly by reviewing the provided Starter Code. This project also provided with the opportunity to work between two machines as I was forced to be mobile while writing the intitial code.
